# Plotting likelihoods

## Introduction

In this section we look at a binomal process (e.g. flipping a coin),
and plot the likelihood curves for the given values of trials and
successes. We can also calculate the likelihood ratio of two
hypotheses

## How-to

The RMarkdown notebook uses a shiny runtime. Firstly the requisite
packages should be installed. Then the notebook can be run in
RStudio using "Run Document".
