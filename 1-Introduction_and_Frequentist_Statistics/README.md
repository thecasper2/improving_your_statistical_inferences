# Introduction and Frequentist Statistics

## Introduction

In this section we can run a number of simulated experiments with a known
population mean, SD, and sample size. For each of those simulations we
run a t-test against a hypothesis mean and then observe the distribution
of p-values across all those simulations.

## How-to

The RMarkdown notebook uses a shiny runtime. Firstly the requisite
packages should be installed. Then the notebook can be run in
RStudio using "Run Document".
